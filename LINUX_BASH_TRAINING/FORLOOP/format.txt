a loop is a block of code that iterates a list of commands as long as the loop control conditions is true

do
  command(s)
done

-------------------
Example 1

for PLANET in Mercury Venus Earth
do 
  echo $PLANET
done

Print
#Mercury
#Venus
#Earth

Explanation
The internal separator recognizes the space between each planet so its able to devide these elements allowing for them to be printed separatedly
-------------------
Example 2

PLANETS="Mercury Venus Earth"
#If Planets are printed like this
"Mercury 
Venus
Earth" then Planets will be printed like above
for PLANET in "$PLANETS"
do
  echo $PLANET
done

Print
#Mercury Venus Earth

Explanation
since there is a double quotation around the plantes the internal separator sees the list as one string which printed them accordingly as one
